-	It seems that players are getting better at making 3-pointers than 10 or 20 years ago (both on average and also top 3-pointer shooters vs. top 3-pointer shooters) Is it true?

```{r}
avgplot2
```

-	If true, what could be the reasons for that?

-	Teams with more 3-pointers tend to be the better performing teams?

-	Are there any relationship between playersâ ages and 3-pointers? Both total and average.

-	Players who are good at 3-pointers are also good at 2-pointers or free throws?

-	Any insights between standings and 3-pointers?

-	Players with high salaries are good at 3-pointers?

-	We want to analyze whether players can drastically improve their three point shooting skills over time or the skill is rather something people are borned with.

-	Show the 3-pointer statistics geographically based on playersâ hometowns. Maybe this help illustrates the different basketball playing style across different regions, both domestic and international.

-	We would like to explore the importance of three point shooters in a given team by measuring the share of the teamâs total salary over time.

-	Focus on three point shooting is a strategy that started fairly recently, we can create a map to show where this strategy initially emerged and how fast it spreaded across the entire country.

-	What are the expected average points of 3-pointers and 2-pointers? Show the historical data.

-	If the expected average point from 3-pointers is getting higher than that of 2-pointers, how should each teamâs strategy changes
